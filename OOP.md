# GO is Object Oriented

* #### 1 Encapsulation

    state (fields)
    behavior (methods)
    exported / un-exported

* ####  2 Reusability

    inheritence (embedded types)

* ####  3 Polymorphism

    interfaces

* ####  4 Overriding

    promotion

## In GO:

* You don't crate classes, you create a type
* You don't instantiate, you create a value of a type
