# Why should I use goroutine?

A goroutine, concurrency, and parallelism is helpful when you have a lot of processing to do. If I needed to process thousands of factorial calculations, then putting them into a goroutine and running those calculations concurrently and in parallel - using all of the CPU cores on my machine, will help those calculations get done faster.
